A speed typing test in Python is an interactive program that measures a user's typing speed and accuracy. By presenting users with random words 
or sentences, the test evaluates how quickly and accurately they can type the provided text. Python offers numerous features and libraries
that enable developers to create engaging typing tests with timers, performance metrics, and interactive user interfaces. These tests are not 
only enjoyable but also useful for improving typing skills and assessing one's proficiency.
Launch the speed typing test program written in Python.
Read the provided text displayed on the screen.
Start typing the text accurately and as quickly as possible.
The timer starts automatically when you begin typing.
Finish typing the entire text or a specified portion within the time limit.
Once completed, the program evaluates your accuracy, measures your typing speed in WPM, and provides a summary of your performance.
Review the results to identify areas for improvement and track your progress over time.
Repeat the test multiple times to practice and enhance your typing skills.
A speed typing test implemented in Python offers an engaging and effective way to measure typing speed and accuracy. 
By leveraging Python's features and libraries, developers can create interactive programs with random text generation, timers, performance 
metrics, and user-friendly interfaces. These tests not only provide an enjoyable activity but also help users assess their typing skills, 
identify areas for improvement, and monitor their progress over time. Whether for personal use or educational purposes, a Python-based speed 
typing test is a valuable tool for enhancing typing proficiency and achieving greater efficiency in text input.
